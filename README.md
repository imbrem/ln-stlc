# ln-stlc

This repository contains a Lean 4 formalization of the simply-typed lambda calculus in the
locally-nameless style, inspired by [Arthur Chargu√©raud's excellent
tutorial](https://www.chargueraud.org/research/2009/ln/main.pdf) on the locally-nameless
representation.

Eventually, hopefully, this will be accompanied by a series of blog posts on
[tekne.dev](https://tekne.dev). Stay tuned!
